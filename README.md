# scraping-udacity
This is a little [code snippet](scrape_udacity.py) in Python 3 to scrape video contents and reading materials from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) nanodegree programmes. To use this snippet, one must install [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org) and an appropriate WebDriver. The nanodegree used as an example in the [Jupyter Notebook](scraping_udacity.ipynb) is the [Machine Learning Engineering Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009).

Please note that one has to have the subscription of a nanodegree in order to scrape its content. The scrapped materials should be for personal use only and in accordance with [Udacity's Terms of Service](https://www.udacity.com/legal).
